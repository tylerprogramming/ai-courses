Translucent jellyfish drift gracefully through deep blue water, their bioluminescent bodies pulsing with soft pink and purple light. The camera moves fluidly among them as they perform an ethereal underwater ballet. Particles of plankton sparkle in shafts of light from above. Ultra HD with rich color saturation and smooth motion. Meditative, peaceful atmosphere.
