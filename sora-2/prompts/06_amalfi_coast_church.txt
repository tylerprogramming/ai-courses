A drone camera circles around a beautiful historic church built on a rocky outcropping along the Amalfi Coast. The view showcases historic and magnificent architectural details with tiered pathways and patios. Waves crash against the rocks below as the view overlooks the horizon of coastal waters and hilly landscapes. Several distant people walk and enjoy vistas on patios. The warm glow of afternoon sun creates a magical romantic feeling.
