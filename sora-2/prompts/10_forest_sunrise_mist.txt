Slow dolly shot through a misty forest at sunrise, golden rays of light piercing through the dense canopy of tall pine trees. Morning fog drifts between the trunks, and dew droplets sparkle on spider webs. The camera glides smoothly forward, revealing layers of depth in the atmospheric scene. Shot on anamorphic lens with warm color temperature.
