A miniature city made entirely of folded paper and origami comes to life. Tiny paper cars drive down streets, paper people walk on sidewalks, and paper birds fly overhead. The sun sets in the background, casting long shadows. Stop-motion animation style with meticulous attention to the texture and folds of the paper. Warm, nostalgic color palette.
