Massive floating islands drift through a pastel sky at sunset. Waterfalls cascade from the edges into clouds below. Small villages with glowing windows sit atop each island, connected by delicate rope bridges. A flock of glowing birds flies between the islands. The camera slowly pans across this fantastical landscape. Whimsical, Studio Ghibli-inspired art style.
