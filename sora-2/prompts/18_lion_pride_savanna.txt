A pride of lions rests under an acacia tree on the African savanna during golden hour. The alpha male surveys the horizon while cubs playfully wrestle nearby. Tall grass sways gently in the warm breeze. The camera slowly dollies around the group, revealing the vast landscape behind them with distant mountains. Cinematic wildlife documentary style, shot on telephoto lens.
