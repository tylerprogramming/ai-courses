Extreme macro shot of a vibrant hummingbird feeding from a bright red hibiscus flower. The camera captures every detail - iridescent feathers shimmering in sunlight, wings beating so fast they're a blur, delicate tongue extending into the flower. Shallow depth of field with bokeh background. Shot at 1000fps slow motion to reveal the intricate wing patterns.
