A giant cathedral is completely filled with cats. There are cats everywhere you look - on pews, hanging from chandeliers, perched on columns. A man enters the cathedral and bows before the giant cat king sitting on an ornate throne. Shafts of colored light stream through stained glass windows, illuminating the surreal scene. Shot with dramatic lighting and shallow depth of field.
