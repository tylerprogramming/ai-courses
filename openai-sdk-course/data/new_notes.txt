Python is a versatile programming language that supports multiple paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

---
Note 1: Variables and Data Types
In Python, variables do not need explicit declaration. For example:
x = 10         # integer
y = 3.14       # float
name = "Alice" # string
is_valid = True # boolean

---
Note 2: Lists and Dictionaries
Lists are ordered collections:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Dictionaries store key-value pairs:
person = {"name": "Bob", "age": 32}

---
Note 3: Loops
For loops iterate over sequences:
for n in numbers:
    print(n)
While loops:
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

---
Note 4: Functions
Functions are defined with 'def':
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("World")

---
Note 5: Classes and Objects
Python uses classes for OOP:
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def bark(self):
        print(self.name + " says woof!")

my_dog = Dog("Rex")
my_dog.bark()

---
Note 6: File I/O
with open("example.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello, file!")

with open("example.txt") as f:
    print(f.read())

---
Note 7: Virtual Environments
Create with:
python -m venv venv
Activate:
source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

---
Note 8: Installing Packages
pip install requests
import requests

---
Note 9: List Comprehensions
squares = [x*x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]

---
Note 10: Exception Handling
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero.")

---
Note 11: Working with Modules
import math
print(math.sqrt(16))

---
Note 12: F-Strings for Formatting
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print(f"{name} is {age} years old.")

---
Note 13: Type Hints
def greet(name: str) -> None:
    print(f"Hello, {name}")

---
Note 14: The Python REPL
Start it by running 'python' in your terminal. Excellent for quick experimentation.

---
Note 15: Using pip to List Installed Packages
pip list

---
Note 16: Docstrings
def multiply(a, b):
    """
    Multiplies two numbers.
    """
    return a * b

---
Note 17: Using map and filter
result = list(map(lambda x: x * 2, numbers))
evens = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))

---
Note 18: Reading JSON
import json
with open("data.json") as f:
    data = json.load(f)

---
Note 19: Writing Your First Script
Create a file named hello.py:
print("Hello, Python!")

Run with: python hello.py

---
Note 20: Getting Help
Use the built-in help() function:
help(print)
help(list)
